    Memory monitor for Linux

    It supports 2 approaches for extracting memory information:
    - linux-native: It parse the `/proc` pseudo-files. It is available only for Linux
    - psutil: Use the `psutil` library

    ## Linux-Native approach

    The linux-native approach implements 2 methods to extract the memory fields:

    1. The `get_memory()` method:

    - It is very fast
    - It parses the `/proc/<pid>/statm` pseudo-file
    - It Contains the following fields:
        size       (1) total program size
                   (same as VmSize in /proc/[pid]/status)
        resident   (2) resident set size
                   (same as VmRSS in /proc/[pid]/status)
        shared     (3) number of resident shared pages (i.e., backed by a file)
                   (same as RssFile+RssShmem in /proc/[pid]/status)
        text       (4) text (code)
        lib        (5) library (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)
        data       (6) data + stack
        dt         (7) dirty pages (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)


    2. The `get_memory_full()` method:

    - It is slower to parse but contains more detailed information
    - It uses regex to parse the `/proc/<pid>/status` pseudo-file
    - It contains the following fields:
        VmPeak: Peak virtual memory size.
        VmSize: Virtual memory size.
        VmLck: Locked memory size (see mlock(2)).
        VmPin: Pinned memory size (since Linux 3.2). These are pages that can't be moved because
               something needs to directly access physical memory.
        VmHWM: Peak resident set size ("high water mark").
        VmRSS: Resident set size.  Note that the value here is the sum of RssAnon, RssFile, and
               RssShmem.
        RssAnon: Size of resident anonymous memory.  (since Linux 4.5).
        RssFile: Size of resident file mappings.  (since Linux 4.5).
        RssShmem: Size of resident shared memory (includes System V shared memory, mappings from
                  tmpfs(5), and shared anonymous mappings).  (since Linux 4.5).
        VmData, VmStk, VmExe: Size of data, stack, and text segments.
        VmLib: Shared library code size.
        VmPTE: Page table entries size (since Linux 2.6.10).
        VmPMD: Size of second-level page tables (added in Linux 4.0; removed in Linux 4.15).
        VmSwap: Swapped-out virtual memory size by anonymous private pages; shmem swap usage is
                not included (since Linux 2.6.34).


    ## The psutil library

    - Apparently the psutil library parses the `/proc/<pid>/statm`
    - The memory_info() function returns the fields: rss, vms, shared, text, lib, data, dirty


    ## Field mappings

    These are the fields returned by psutil memory_info() and their mapping in the /proc files:
    (I put ? when I am not 100% about the mapping)

    | psutil  | /proc/$$/status    | /proc/$$/statm |
    |---------|--------------------|----------------|
    | rss     | VmRSS              | resident       |
    | vms     | VmSize             | size           |
    | shared  | RssFile + RssShmem | shared         |
    | text    | VmExe ?            | text           |
    | lib     | RssShmem ?         | lib            |
    | data    | VmData + VmStk     | data           |
    | dirty   | VmSwap ?           | dt             |
